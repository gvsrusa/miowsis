# Supabase Authentication Test Plan

## Test Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Supabase authentication integration in the Miowsis platform.

### Current Implementation Status
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot with JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: React with Redux Toolkit, currently using mock authentication service
- **Target**: Supabase authentication integration

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Authentication Service Tests
- [ ] Supabase client initialization
- [ ] Login with email/password
- [ ] Registration with email/password
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification

#### Redux Store Tests
- [ ] Auth slice actions
- [ ] Auth state management
- [ ] Token persistence
- [ ] User data updates
- [ ] Error handling

#### React Hook Tests
- [ ] useAuth hook functionality
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Auto-refresh behavior
- [ ] Authentication state updates

### 2. Integration Tests

#### API Integration
- [ ] Supabase Auth API connectivity
- [ ] Error response handling
- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior

#### Component Integration
- [ ] ProtectedRoute behavior
- [ ] Login form submission
- [ ] Registration form validation
- [ ] Session persistence across page reloads

### 3. End-to-End Tests

#### User Flows
- [ ] Complete registration process
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Logout and session cleanup
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Protected route access
- [ ] Session timeout handling

### 4. Security Tests

#### Authentication Security
- [ ] XSS prevention in auth forms
- [ ] CSRF token validation
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] Session hijacking prevention
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Password strength validation

#### Authorization Tests
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Resource-level permissions
- [ ] API endpoint protection
- [ ] Token expiration handling

### 5. Performance Tests

#### Load Testing
- [ ] Concurrent login requests
- [ ] Token refresh under load
- [ ] Session management scalability
- [ ] Database connection pooling

#### Response Time Tests
- [ ] Login response time
- [ ] Token verification speed
- [ ] Session retrieval performance

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Registration
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Enter valid user details
3. Submit registration form
4. Verify email confirmation sent
5. Confirm email
6. Verify user can login

**Expected Result**: User successfully registered and can access the application

### Scenario 2: User Login
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Submit login form
4. Verify redirect to dashboard
5. Check session persistence

**Expected Result**: User logged in with valid session

### Scenario 3: Invalid Login Attempts
1. Attempt login with incorrect password
2. Attempt login with non-existent email
3. Attempt login with malformed email
4. Check error messages

**Expected Result**: Appropriate error messages displayed, no access granted

### Scenario 4: Session Management
1. Login successfully
2. Close browser
3. Reopen application
4. Verify user still authenticated
5. Wait for token expiration
6. Verify auto-refresh or re-login prompt

**Expected Result**: Sessions persist appropriately and expire as configured

### Scenario 5: Protected Routes
1. Access protected route without authentication
2. Verify redirect to login
3. Login successfully
4. Verify redirect back to requested route

**Expected Result**: Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes

### Scenario 6: Concurrent Sessions
1. Login from multiple devices
2. Verify all sessions valid
3. Logout from one device
4. Check other sessions remain active

**Expected Result**: Multiple sessions handled correctly

## Test Data Requirements

### Valid Test Users
- Standard user: test@miowsis.com / Test123!
- Admin user: admin@miowsis.com / Admin123!
- Unverified user: unverified@miowsis.com / Unverified123!

### Invalid Test Cases
- Malformed emails
- Weak passwords
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS payloads

## Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
- Supabase project with test database
- Test API keys configured
- Mock email service for verification

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated test execution
- Test coverage reporting
- Security scanning

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- Integration tests complete without errors
- E2E tests run successfully in multiple browsers
- Security tests show no vulnerabilities
- Performance meets defined SLAs:
  - Login < 2 seconds
  - Token refresh < 500ms
  - Session check < 100ms

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Privacy**: Test data must not contain real user information
2. **API Limits**: Supabase rate limiting during load tests
3. **Network Dependencies**: Tests failing due to network issues
4. **Token Security**: Ensuring tokens are not exposed in logs

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use synthetic test data
- Implement test throttling
- Add retry mechanisms
- Secure logging configuration

## Reporting

### Test Reports Should Include
- Test execution summary
- Pass/fail rates by category
- Performance metrics
- Security scan results
- Code coverage reports
- Identified issues with severity

### Issue Tracking
- Critical: Security vulnerabilities, authentication bypass
- High: Login failures, session issues
- Medium: Performance degradation, UX issues
- Low: Minor UI bugs, non-critical warnings
