## 11. Automated UI Testing and Refinement Instructions

### UI Development Workflow with Playwright MCP

When working on UI changes, follow this automated testing and refinement workflow:

#### 1. Initial UI Implementation
- Implement the UI changes based on the PRD requirements
- Ensure all components follow the design system guidelines

#### 2. Automated Visual Testing
**IMPORTANT**: After making any UI changes, you MUST use Playwright MCP to:

1. **Navigate to the changed page**:
   ```
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to go to the page
   ```

2. **Take screenshots**:
   ```
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot to capture the current UI state
   ```

3. **Analyze the UI**:
   - Check if the layout matches the design requirements
   - Verify spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
   - Ensure animations are smooth (60fps minimum)
   - Validate color contrast ratios (9.66:1 for WCAG AAA)

4. **Test interactions**:
   ```
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_click for button interactions
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_type for form inputs
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_hover for hover states
   ```

5. **Check responsiveness**:
   ```
   Use mcp__playwright__browser_resize to test different screen sizes:
   - Mobile: 375x667 (iPhone SE)
   - Tablet: 768x1024 (iPad)
   - Desktop: 1920x1080
   ```

#### 3. Automated Refinement Loop
If the UI doesn't meet standards, automatically:

1. **Identify issues** from the screenshot:
   - Misaligned elements
   - Incorrect spacing
   - Color contrast problems
   - Missing animations
   - Broken responsive layouts

2. **Make corrections** in the code:
   - Adjust CSS properties
   - Fix component structure
   - Update animation timing
   - Correct responsive breakpoints

3. **Re-test** with Playwright:
   - Take new screenshots
   - Compare with requirements
   - Repeat until satisfied

#### 4. Accessibility Testing
Use Playwright to verify:
- Tab navigation flow
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Focus indicators

#### 5. Performance Validation
- Measure page load times
- Check animation frame rates
- Verify smooth scrolling
- Test interaction responsiveness

### Example Workflow Script

When implementing a new dashboard widget:

1. Implement the widget component
2. Run Playwright test:
   ```
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Take screenshot of widget
   - Click interactive elements
   - Check hover states
   - Resize browser to test responsiveness
   - Take screenshots at each breakpoint
   ```
3. If issues found:
   - Fix the code
   - Re-run tests
   - Continue until UI meets all requirements

### Success Criteria
The UI is considered satisfactory when:
- All visual elements align with design system
- Animations run at 60fps
- Responsive behavior works correctly
- Accessibility standards are met
- No visual bugs in screenshots
- User interactions feel smooth and intuitive

### Required Playwright MCP Tools

## 12. Component Development with Latest Documentation

### Using Context7 MCP for Up-to-Date Library Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Before adding or modifying components, ALWAYS fetch the latest documentation using Context7 MCP to ensure you're using current best practices and APIs.

#### Workflow for Component Development

1. **Identify the Libraries/Frameworks in Use**
   - Check package.json for installed dependencies
   - Review existing components to understand the tech stack
   - Common libraries in this project: React, React Native, Three.js, D3.js, Framer Motion

2. **Fetch Latest Documentation**
   Before implementing any component, use Context7 MCP:
   
   ```
   Step 1: Resolve library ID
   Use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with the library name
   Example: "react", "framer-motion", "three.js", "d3"
   
   Step 2: Get documentation
   Use mcp__context7__get-library-docs with the resolved ID
   Include relevant topics like "hooks", "components", "animations"
   ```

3. **Review Documentation Before Implementation**
   - Check for deprecated methods
   - Look for new recommended patterns
   - Understand performance best practices
   - Review accessibility guidelines

4. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Follow the patterns from the latest documentation
   - Use recommended hooks and APIs
   - Implement according to current best practices
   - Avoid deprecated or outdated approaches

#### Example Workflow

When adding a new animated dashboard widget:

1. **Check current libraries**:
   ```
   - React for component structure
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - D3.js for data visualization
   ```

2. **Fetch documentation**:
   ```
   - mcp__context7__resolve-library-id for "framer-motion"
   - mcp__context7__get-library-docs with topic "animations"
   - mcp__context7__resolve-library-id for "d3"
   - mcp__context7__get-library-docs with topic "charts"
   ```

3. **Implement based on latest docs**:
   - Use latest React hooks (useId, useSyncExternalStore if recommended)
   - Apply current Framer Motion animation patterns
   - Follow D3.js v7+ best practices

#### Required Context7 MCP Tools
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Find the correct library ID
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Fetch up-to-date documentation

### Documentation Priority List

Always fetch documentation for these libraries when working on:

1. **UI Components**: React, React Native
2. **Animations**: Framer Motion, Lottie
3. **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Three.js
4. **State Management**: Check if Redux/Zustand/Context is used
5. **Styling**: Check CSS-in-JS library (styled-components, emotion)
6. **Forms**: React Hook Form, Formik (if used)
7. **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright

### Benefits of This Approach
- Ensures use of latest APIs and best practices
- Avoids deprecated methods
- Implements performance optimizations
- Follows current accessibility standards
- Reduces technical debt

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
